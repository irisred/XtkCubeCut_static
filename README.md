# XtkCubeCut_static
a demo using xtk to do csg operation
xtk can be used to do csg operation, but I don't find the way to do it in a callback function, such as renderer3D.onRender() or requestAnimationFrame(callback).
so this demo don't contain callback way to do csg operation.
If you know how to do the csg operation in a callback function, please finish the code.
